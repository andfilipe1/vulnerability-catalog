>status: development

Welcome to Vulnerability Catalog project, a catalog for IT environments with **multiple or diffuse sources of vulnerability-related information**.

Vulnerability catalog is a WEB application written in Python/Django providing an **organized, centralized and easy-to-use catalog** to keep track of environment's/organization vulnerabilities.

By providing a way to produce the same measurement basis for any vulnerability, risks and severities can be evaluated more accuratedly, **without the inherent biases derived from the providers' evaluation**. Be your environment evaluated by your metrics. That's the idea.

It can be also used as a **roadmap** and a **timeline**  map to treat vulnerabilities in an efficient way and keep track of environment status and progress. 

By the way, see the [project's Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for updates and more details.

# Running development branch into your box
To run Vulnerability Catalog in your box (develop mode only), you'll need a linux box. I suggest you to try Ubuntu or Fedora, for simplicity.

1. In a terminal, get the files and go to its directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog.git

cd vulnerability-catalog
```

2. Run the installer:
```sh
./linux-installer
```

3. Follow the instructions to provide systems' dependencies and point your browser to

>http://localhost:8000/catalog


# Tips to developers

The project has 2 Bash scripts to help you to develop it easier.

1. linux-installer:

**linux-installer** responsible to set all Django required files and start the Catalog properly. It accepts the following parameteres:

```sh
./linux-installer
```

without any parameters, it starts to set Django properly and run the project into your box. It will also **load the project with a ficticious database** to help you to understand better how it works.


```sh
./linux-installer urlsviews
```

updates catalog app urls and views without rebuild the entire project.

```sh
./linux-installer templatesonly
```

updates catalog templates without rebuild the entire project.

2. run

**run** is just a launch alias to the Django project. 

### Example:

If you made some minor change, like a template update or a url/view change, instead of rebuild the entire project (and add your users again, log into the app and so one) just try:

```sh
./linux-installer templatesonly 

or

./linux-installer urlsviews

and then

./run
```
It will update your changes without reconstruct everything again.

## Motivation

The idea to start this effort came from my experience trying to keep track of vulnerabilities during the Olympic and Paralympic Games at Rio 2016 - The Rio de Janeiro Olympics. During that time, I realized three important things concerning vulnerability management:

1. it is hard to **centralize all information** we got from vulnerability reports, assessments, pentests, user/peers report in a consistent way.
2. it is hard to put **relevant information**, like risks and severity, **in a common (and normalized) base**.
3. it is hard to **visualize and get insights** about the enviroment **when we have multiple and diffuse sources of data**, comming from .pdf, .xslx, .doc files or even by e-mail or other channels.

So, Vulnerability catalog emerges trying to address and make things like that a little bit easier. With Catalog, we can unify, put data into a normal basis and manage vulnerabilities better than if you try to do this by using sheets or reading reports one-by-one each time.
