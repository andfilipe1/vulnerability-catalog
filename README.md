# vulnerability-catalog
Welcome to Vulnerability Catalog project, a catalog for IT environments with **multiple or diffuse sources of vulnerability-related information**.

# Screenshots:
## Vulnerability add form
This is the vulnerability input form. Its goal is to guide admins through relevant questions in order to provide a consistent information retrieval and processing:

## The vulnerability pannel
This pannel presents all the catalogued vulnerabilities and their principal attributes. It is designed to keep track of the overall environment health and treatment status:

# Running development branch into your box
To run Vulnerability Catalog in your box (develop mode only), you'll need a linux box. I suggest you to try Ubuntu or Fedora, for simplicity.

1. In a terminal, get the files and go to its directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/daavelino/vulnerability-catalog.git

cd vulnerability-catalog
```

2. Run the installer:
```sh
./linux-installer
```

3. Follow the instructions to provide systems' dependencies and point your browser to

>http://localhost:8000/catalog


# Tips to developers

The project has 2 Bash scripts to help you develop easier.

1. linux-installer:

**linux-installer** responsible to set all Django required files and start the Catalog properly. It accepts the following parameteres:

```sh
./linux-installer
```

without any parameters, it starts to set Django properly and run the project into your box. It will also **load the project with a ficticious database** to help you understand better how it works.


```sh
./linux-installer urlsviews
```

updates catalog app urls and views without rebuild the entire project.

```sh
./linux-installer templatesonly
```

updates catalog templates without rebuild the entire project.


# TODO:
Please check at [project's Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) for updates and more details.
