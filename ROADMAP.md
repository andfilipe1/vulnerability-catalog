# Vulnerability-Catalog Project's Roadmap:


1. Create an add vulnerability page to substitute admin/catalog/vulnerability/add.

>Acceptable when catalog/vulnerability/add/ substitutes admin/catalog/vulnerability/add.

Status: **Work in progress**.

2. Insert the cvss v3 calculator code into add vulnerability page to compute and fill the Cvss score field.

>Acceptable when Base Score Metrics code could be inserted into add page and the cvss score calculation provides the v3-calculator (Basic Score Metrics) to fill 'Cvss score' field with [0-10] value properly.

Please, refer to

https://www.first.org/cvss/use-design and

https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator

Status: **To be done**.

3. Create a Risk calculator (like Cvss calculator) to help users to evaluate risks properly. It must be inserted at catalog/vulnerability/add/ form to compute and fill the Risk field. The idea is that users can use a common risk base to evaluate vulnerabilities risks properly.

>Acceptable when an acceptable common Risk base could be designed and implemented properly to fill Risk fields with High, Medium or Low values. It must be simple to use (require just few clicks) and not redirect to any other page.

Status: **To be done**.

4. Review project models.py to ensure that catalog/data/json/alldatabase/ generate the best possible json file. It seems that it is possible to relate data field accordingly and create a better structured database model (and so a better json file) to fill usage expectations.

>Acceptable when all duplicated fiels where removed from catalog/data/json/alldatabase/ response and a better structured json data could be provided.

Status: **To be done**.

5. Design a 404 template and redirect all not found requests to that.

>Acceptable when all not found requests redirect to the desired page.

Status: **To be done**.

6. Desing the charts using Data-Driven Documents (d3) that should be present at /catalog/panorama/ using (possibly) catalog/data/json/alldatabase/ json data.

>Acceptable when Perimeter, Risk Level, Top Systems by vulnerabilities number, Top category by vulnerabilities number, systems and vulnerabilities number relation and Found/Solved metrics could be present by using d3 charts.

Please refer to

https://d3js.org/

Status: **To be done**.

7. Create a home page where users could land at first contact with vulnerability-catalog.

>Acceptable when users land at home page and get instructions about how to use it.

Status: **To be done**.

8. Ensure a minimalistic and easy-to-use desing to the project.

>Acceptable when project minimize user's interaction and all features could be beautiful and meaningful to use.

Status: **To be done**.

9. Add support to other databases other than SQLite.

>Acceptable when mysql/mariadb, Oracle and PostgreSQL support could be choosen at installation process.

Status: **To be done**.

10. Check security and usability issues to enable web usage.

>Acceptable when project pass against pentests and vulnerability assessments.

Status: **To be done**.
